# Plagiarism Checker (Mini Version)

This project detects similarity between two text inputs using:

- TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
- Cosine Similarity
- Basic NLP concepts

## How It Works

1. Takes two text inputs
2. Converts text into TF-IDF vectors
3. Calculates cosine similarity
4. Displays similarity percentage

## How to Run

1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the program:
   python app.py

## Output

The system shows similarity percentage between two texts.
